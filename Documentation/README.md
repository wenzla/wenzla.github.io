# wenzla.github.io

This is the website of all my html projects.

## Index

Has all the projects as links and a testing area for me to test code before I make a new project.

## Parker Flow Calculator

Flow calculator to determine the flow rate and V/L ratio of Parker FTS series pumps given an environment setup.

## Parker Long Video

A simple chapter selector for a video made for Parker.  Uploaded to YouTube since file was to big for GitHub Pages.

## Test Page

This space is used for testing.  On the actual site, there should be no tests as all tests are done in the development branch.
Page is basically used as a template html page when I want to create a new page.
